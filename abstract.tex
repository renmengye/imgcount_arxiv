We propose an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN)
architecture with an attention mechanism to 
model a human-like counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentation. 
The network is jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of
interest as well as a dominant object segmentation within each region. The
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the CVPPP leaf segmentation
dataset \cite{minervini14cvppp} and KITTI vehicle segmentation dataset
\cite{geiger12kitti}.
