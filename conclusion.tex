\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we borrow intuition from human counting and formulate instance
segmentation and counting as a recurrent attentive process. Our end-to-end
recurrent architecture demonstrates significant improvement compared to earlier
exploration of using RNN on the same tasks, and shows state-of-the-art results
on challenging leaf and car segmentation datasets. We address the classic
object occlusion problem with a recurrent external memory, and the attention
structure brings segmentation at a fine resolution. Our model also shows
promising counting performance on a portion of the MS-COCO dataset.
